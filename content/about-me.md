Hi. My name is Robert Curth. I am 38 years old and live in Munich (Germany).

## Programmer

I am a part-time programmer at [Pharos](https://www.pharos.de/home/) and a worker-owner at [TechGenossen](https://techgenossen.de).

I program in Ruby (on Rails) these days on [Webgate.io](https://webgate.io/) and various TechGenossen projects.

## Traveler

I travel a lot. I visited [~45 countries](/countries-visited) during my lifetime. Most of them in the last 10 years.

## Self-improver

After work I try to invest into my skills and mind. That means: I exercise, meditate, [read](/books-read) and learn a lot.
