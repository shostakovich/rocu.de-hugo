Often I feel bad after watching an ad, reading an article about the next health gadget, after watching Apple keynotes or browsing on Amazon.

I feel like I have a hole in the stomach. I have to fight internal fights. Shall I buy the thing I didnâ€™t even know about a few minutes ago?

Often I loose and buy. Despite knowing better.

Worst of all â€” it became apparent to me that these holes in my stomach cannot be filled by stuff. They appear again and again and again.

## *Getting rid of ads*

Here is what I do since about a year - and it works quite well. I got rid of many ads:

- Install anÂ [AdBlocker plugin](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/adblock/gighmmpiobklfepjocnamgkkbiglidom)Â for your browser
- [Block Amazon and other shopping sites](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/block-site/eiimnmioipafcokbfikbljfdeojpcgbh)Â that you tend to browse
- Prevent watching TV ads
- [Unsubscribe from all email-newsletters at once](https://unroll.me/)

For all other ads: Try to catch yourself watching as them. When you catch yourself, go on with your life.

For example, I look at tobacco ads quite frequently. I have no idea why â€” I donâ€™t even smoke.

## *Ads work*

They work against your financial freedom. They work against your happiness.

Do not let them punch holes into your stomach and your purse.
