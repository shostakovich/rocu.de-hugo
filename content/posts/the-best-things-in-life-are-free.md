- **The sun** - Amazing for your mood and health. Good against feeling depressed.
- **Love** - Absolutely free.
- **Body weight exercises** - You are your own gym.
- **Plants** - Yes they are (nearly) free to. If you grow your own plants all you need is seeds, soil and water.
- **Happiness** - Free. You only get it, when you stop striving. It’s really about your attitude - not about money.
- **Libraries** - Nearly free. Big houses with more books on everything, then you could ever read.
- **Walks outside** - Prevents a whole range of diseases, good for your mood, prolongs your life.
- **Creativity** - Completely free. You might even find a paid outlet for it.
- **Kind words** - Free. Can have a profound impact.
- **Singing Birds** - Just listen and marvel.
- **Butterflies**
- **Listening** - A great gift. No need for answers.
- **Smiles** - Make you wake up and remember that life is glorious.
- **Animals** - Great teachers. They see the world as it is. Not as they think it is.
- **Sleeping In on a Rainy Day** - Free of charge. What a great pleasure.
- **Beautiful views** - Like Sunsets or the really nice old tree bathing in the sun.
- **Holding the hand of someone you love** - Priceless. And one of the greatest feelings on earth.

To spend less money, patch up all the holes that advertisements and “common sense” tear into your psyche.

Enjoy life’s free gifts.
