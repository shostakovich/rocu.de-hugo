__Welcome to rocu.de, my personal website.__

I tried a lot of hosting options during the over 20 years of it existence. First I manually wrote my own HTML, then came hand-crafted PHP, Wordpress, Ghost, Rails, Jekyll, Micro.blog - just to name a few approaches.

Nowadays, I program so much at work, that I decided to not maintain my own blog anymore.

What you see here is only a public part of my Notion Workspace.
