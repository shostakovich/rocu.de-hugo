# Rails: Preview your emails with MailCatcher

Do you know the feeling of copy and pasting the signup-link from thisÂ `development.log`? Thereâ€™s a better way to do this.

For our development environment, we use MailCatcher.

<aside>
ðŸ“¨ MailCatcher runs a super simple SMTP server which catches any message sent to it to display in a web interface. Run MailCatcher, set your favorite app to deliver to smtp://127.0.0.1:1025 instead of your default SMTP server, then check outÂ http://127.0.0.1:1080Â to see the mail thatâ€™s arrived so far.

</aside>

In this blogpost, I show you how we set it up in our projects.

MailCatcher is a wonderful way to preview all the mails your Rails App sends in the development environment.

## *Installation*

Add MailCatcher and Foreman to yourÂ `Gemfile`Â :

```ruby
group :development do
  gem 'mailcatcher'
  gem 'foreman'
end

```

RunÂ `bundle install`.

Create a file namedÂ `Procfile`. This is used to start Rails and MailCatcher together with one simple command.

```
web: rails s
mail: mailcatcher -f
```

The last step is to configure Rails to send emails to MailCatcher:

Add these 2 lines to yourÂ `config/environments/development.rb`.

```ruby
config.action_mailer.delivery_method = :smtp
config.action_mailer.smtp_settings = { address: 'localhost', port: 1025 }
```

Now you can runÂ `foreman start`Â every time you want to start Rails.

This will start Rails and MailCatcher (which listens on portÂ `1080`).

## *Using MailCatcher*

Every time Rails sends an email, MailCatcher will receive it and display it on atÂ [http://localhost:1080/](http://localhost:1080/).

You can toggle between the HTML and the text portion of the email, and even inspect the source.

## *And what if I do not use Rails?*

Good news for you. You can also use MailCatcher without Rails.

1. Just install MailCatcher viaÂ `gem install mailcatcher`
2. Point your application to send mails via SMTP to portÂ `1025`.
3. RunÂ `mailcatcher`.
4. Go toÂ [http://localhost:1080/](http://localhost:1080/).

## *Conclusion*

MailCatcher is one of these tools that we end up using whenever we start to send emails in a new project. I hope you like it as well.
