I am quite excited about Avdi Grimm’s new project [Ruby Tapas](https://www.rubytapas.com/).

Three times a week, Avdi post short videos about different concepts and techniques in Ruby.

The first 3 episodes were short, but I already learned some obscure details of Ruby that I didn’t know about

I think that over many weeks, that should give me a pretty solid knowledge of the parts of Ruby that I do not touch in my daily work.
