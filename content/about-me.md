Hi. My name is Robert Curth. I am 39 years old and live in Munich (Germany).

## Programmer

I am a freelance web-developer. I work for [Pharos](https://www.pharos.de/home/) and am a worker-owner at [TechGenossen eG](https://techgenossen.de).

I program in Ruby (on Rails) these days on [Webgate.io](https://webgate.io/) and various TechGenossen projects.

## Traveler

I travel a lot. I visited [58 countries](/countries-visited) during my lifetime. Most of them during the last 15 years.

## Self-improver

After work I try to invest into my skills and mind. That means: I exercise, meditate, [read](/books-read) and learn a lot.
