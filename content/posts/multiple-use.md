Today, many products have only one use. Waffle irons, rice cookers, fondue sets, popcorn makers, toasters…

While many of these appliances are good at what they do — I do not use them regularly. They are wasteful.

I live in a small flat and I prefer not to waste money — so I love to have only a few items with multiple use.

They are essentials, versatile. You find many of them in every household. They are so common, that they are often overlooked.

Just a few examples:

**Knife**: letter opener, vegetable slicer, garlic press, weapon, fruit peeler

**A big pot**: rice cooker, water cooker, store food, a fryer, fondue, popcorn machine

**Paper**: transports messages, packaging, insulation, for art, fire starter

**Vinegar**: ingredient, insect catcher, descaler, cleaner

**Duct tape**: Remember MacGyver?

Using items for different things requires you to learn small new skills — often these skills are learned faster than it would take to order a specialized appliance.

You are rewarded with a new skill, more money, more fun and more space in your life.

Before buying something new, I try to think about the stuff I own. Lots of stuff. With many, many uses.

Can I use these water bottles as weights? Aren’t these books a nice stand for my notebook? Why not use this egg-carton to grow plants? This used box - great for my socks. Beat that IKEA.
