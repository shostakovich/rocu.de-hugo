# Teaching Happiness

Today I watched this documentary, and it deeply moved me. It is about an old teacher, who teaches his students something relevant. Compassion, friendship, and happiness.

His work touches me on a deep level. I cried quite a lot. I hope you like the documentary as much as I do!
