> To laugh often and love much;
> 
> to win the respect of intelligent persons
> and the affection of children;
> 
> to earn the approbation of honest critics
> and to endure the betrayal of false friends;
> 
> to appreciate beauty;
> 
> to find the best in others;
> 
> to give of oneself;
> 
> to leave the world a bit better, whether by a healthy child,
> 
> a garden patch or redeemed social condition;
> 
> to have played and laughed with enthusiasm and sung with exultation;
> 
> to know that even one life has breathed easier because you have lived–
> this is to have succeeded.
