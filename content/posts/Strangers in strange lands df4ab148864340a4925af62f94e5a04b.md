We can remember between 5 and 9 digits.

So, why do we value our thoughts so much?

Gaze at a flower and it is marvelous. — Look with a mental projection in your head, and you only see a representation. You look at the thought of a flower.

So let’s try to be like a child. Let’s try to open our eyes and just see.

Let’s marvel at the flowers.
